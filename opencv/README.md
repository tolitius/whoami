## Looking at OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library

based on the example from [FaceDetect](https://github.com/shantnu/FaceDetect)

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
```

```bash
$ python detect_faces.py ../doc/img
../doc/img/freddie.jpg: did not find faces
../doc/img/image.jpg: did not find faces
../doc/img/queen.jpg: faces found: 2
next?
```
